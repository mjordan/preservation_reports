# Preservation Reports

## Introduction

Beginnings of a Drupal 8 module to provide reports relevant to preservation of resources managed by Islandora.

## Overview

Currently doesn't do anything other than display a couple of sample charts at "Admin > Reports > Preservation reports" generated from dummy data:

1.  a pie chart containing dummy data showing relative numbers of Preservation Masters with 'image/tiff', 'video/mpeg', 'audio/mpeg' MIME types:
2.  a sample line chart showing fixity check event failures over the last year

![Sample charts](docs/sample_charts.png)

Intended functionality is to get this data (and other types of "preservation" data) from Solr (which implies that the data must be indexed in Solr), or other sources, such as the [RipRap](https://github.com/mjordan/riprap) fixity microservice.

## Requirements

* [Islandora](https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/islandora) a.k.a. CLAW

Uses the [Chart.js Javascript library](http://www.chartjs.org/) for now. Chart.js is not a local requirement, since it is called from a CDN. We should probably use the [Charts](https://www.drupal.org/project/charts) contrib module once it moves out of beta for Drupal 8.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo into your Islandora's `drupal/web/modules/contrib` directory.
1. Enable the module either under the "Admin > Extend" menu or by running `drush en -y preservation_reports`.
